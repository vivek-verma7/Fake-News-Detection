## 🚀 What We Built

A modular, high-performance pipeline to classify news as **real or fake** by leveraging:

- 🔁 **LSTM Networks** – Efficient for small or moderately sized datasets.
- 🤖 **Transformer Models** – Fine-tuned **BERT** and **RoBERTa** for contextual, language-rich understanding.
- 🧠 **Ensemble Learning** – Combining multiple models to improve robustness and accuracy.
